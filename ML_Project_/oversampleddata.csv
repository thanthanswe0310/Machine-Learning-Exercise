719,Streaming Data Memory Growth,Expected Behaviour
720,I have been using spacy for streaming data (twitter and news stories mostly) and I believe that the fundamental design of the vocab/StringStore in spacy is problematic for streaming processing.,Motivation
721,"When used for batch jobs the additional memory overhead of storing a new lexeme struct for each new word form encountered in parsing is negligible compared to the speed gains, and because most text conforms to the assumption that vocabulary size grows logarithmically as the total number of tokens grows linearly this is usually a safe bet.",Motivation
722,"But for streaming text, especially for social media where new terms are invented by the minute (hashtags and URLs in particular) this assumption no longer holds and the spacy vocabulary storage represents a dynamic element in what should be a completely static production deployment.",Motivation
723,"In order to test this assumption, I took one million tweets and performed a rudimentary analysis using the resources module in python to get the maximum memory used by the program at regular intervals during processing.",Observed Bug Behaviour
724,"I first performed some minor preprocessing to remove newlines from the data so that it could be read line by line so that it wouldn't all be kept in memory, then I ran spacy with all models set to false, only the tokenizer loaded.",Observed Bug Behaviour
725,"I then did the same thing again after removing all URLs, hashtags, and twitter mentions from the data , and then filtering all empty strings (this resulted in a 1.4% data loss in terms of total tweets processed but that's fairly minor).",Observed Bug Behaviour
726,The final result was that spacy used an additional 278.6 MB after tokenizing the raw tweets and 60.99 MB of additional memory when tokenizing the pre-processed tweets.,Observed Bug Behaviour
727,This result confirms my hypothesis but also shows that the memory increase really isn't all that significant (especially at the relatively low volume that I am currently processing).,Investigation and Exploration
728,But it still points to a potential flaw in the design of the library.,Investigation and Exploration
729,My suggestion/request in the near term would be to have an option to make the vocabulary read only so that users who want to be able to leave spacy alone to do streaming data processing don't need to worry about changing memory requirements.,Expected Behaviour
730,"In the long term, I think that an optimal solution would be to add some functionality for a timeout on vocabulary entries that aren't loaded at initialization.",Expected Behaviour
731,"E.g. if this lexeme hasn't been accessed for the last _n_ seconds, delete it from the StringStore.",Expected Behaviour
732,And _n_ would be user configurable.,Expected Behaviour

888,"I think the CODE method isn't actually to blame here â rather, it reports on an error condition thrown by the CODE method, while the CODE method fails silently in the same situation.",Investigation and Exploration

890,"I haven't stepped through the automaton yet (if you want to do that, use the methodCODE) to see exactly where the problem is, but I'm pretty sure the error will come from an interaction with entities pre-set by the CODE class.",Investigation and Exploration
891,"In order to preserve these entities, we restrict the actions of the entity recogniser, so that it can't over-write the previous ones.",Investigation and Exploration
892,"There's apparently a bug in the logic to introduce this constraint, that's leaving the automaton with no available actions.",Investigation and Exploration

1486,"[**TL;DR:** We're designing a new input pipeline API for TensorFlow, and we'd like to collect your feature requests on this issue.]",Motivation
1487,We've noticed that one of the biggest challenges in getting started with TensorFlow is how to load your own data into your programs.,Motivation
1488,"While TensorFlow has several methods that can be used to build complex input pipelines (such as [CODE] URL , [CODE] URL , etc.), they were designed for a particular use case (processing a static set of files repeatedly), and the average user experience with these methods is not great.",Motivation
1489,For example:,Motivation
1490,"*         Once you reach the end of a pipeline, it becomes closed and you can never use it again in the same session.",Motivation
1491,*         See #2514 and #4535 for feature requests about handling multiple epochs.,Motivation
1492,*         See #7902 and numerous Stack Overflow questions for examples of processing different datasets in the same program.,Motivation
1493,"*         The current pipelines use TensorFlow queues and multiple Python threads, which can lead to poor performance (lock contention in the queues and the Python GIL) and hard-to-understand exceptions (CODE).",Motivation
1494,*         See #6845 for a discussion of input pipeline performance.,Motivation
1495,*         See #7525 and [many more Stack Overflow questions] URL  for an example of the confusing error.,Motivation
1496,"*         The pipelines behave poorly if you forget to call CODE: in fact, they hang indefinitely and deadlock the user program.",Motivation
1497,*         See #7945 and [many Stack Overflow questions] URL  for some examples of users who have been bitten by this problem.,Motivation
1498,We're decided to start from a clean slate and redesign the input pipeline API.,Task Progress
1499,"The existing methods will remain until TF 2.0 (at least), but we are planning to add a new set of methods for loading and manipulating datasets.",Task Progress
1500,"We will provide methods for creating datasets from tensors, and deriving them from another dataset (e.g. by slicing its elements, repeating its elements, shuffling its elements, batching its elements, mapping a function over its elements, etc.).",Usage
1501,"There will be explicit operations for initializing an iterator, so that it can be reused after you have processed all of the elements in a dataset.",Usage
1502,"A similar pattern turns up in many different settings, including [Java's Stream API] URL , [Scala's collections] URL  (and hence Spark's RDDs), and [.NET's Language Integrated Query] URL .",Motivation
1503,We're announcing this plan early because we want to collect feedback on what features you&mdash;as TensorFlow users&mdash;would like to see in an input pipeline API.,Motivation
1504,What other pain points have we missed?,Motivation

1508,"A must-have for one of our use cases is ad-hoc creation of data elements via a callback function (which creates tensors on the fly, e.g. using py_func() or through some other means).",Motivation
1509,"More specifically, we currently have a use case where we employ two queues; an outer one, using a string_input_producer (with shuffling), where each string denotes/points to a ""data set"", and the inner queue is then produced by generating a variable amount of samples from each ""data set"".",Motivation
1510,Which and how many samples are generated differs per epoch (potentially conditional on past training behavior).,Motivation
1511,"Actually, we don't even use the nomenclature of an epoch anymore, since the same data is never seen twice, and above mentioned generation/sampling goes beyond the usual data augmentation.",Motivation
1512,"Long story short: With a slightly out-of-the-ordinary use case, we've been hit by pretty much all of the problems you have mentioned above, and our workarounds have not been pretty.",Motivation
1513,"We'd be extremely happy to see a very flexible mechanism, where such cases are supported, and data generation doesn't have to be shoehorned into forced-upon concepts like epochs, finitely repeating queues, etc.",Motivation
1514,(although they can be modeled by its primitives).,Motivation
1515,"Edit: Things we still need of course, include multi-threaded data generation, and multi-threaded random shuffle producer-consumer queues.",Expected Behaviour

1529,There are clear problems with queues like you said.,Motivation
1530,"A minor issue for which I offer no solution is that while the scheduling(how long to train for before validate) is done perhaps by some method of a model class that I would like to be dataset-independent, whether it makes sense to talk in terms of iter or epoch is determined by the dataset--ruining some of the independence.",Motivation

1550,2.         (theoretically) doesn't require an extra python thread in the training process.,Motivation
1551,"3.         If the message protocol supports pub/sub, then (1) multiple training sessions can subcribe and reuse the same input data, which is very useful when trying new models.",Motivation

1641,I can only find some basic infos in the C++ API docs.,Motivation
1642,Would be really interested to read something for the Python API + some example code.,Expected Behaviour

1659,"I'd support @nicolasdespres for ""no Dataset"" pledge, mainly because all-in-one bundle is not flexible, not future proof and also - not consistent with the TF's paradigm of providing small, stable, well-defined and assemble-able blocks for building custom models.",Motivation
1660,"Having some bundles, predefined ""easy-starter"" wrappers should be welcomed.",Expected Behaviour
1661,"In fact for these kinds of higher-level abstractions, sooner seems better than later â one of the greatest frustrations of reading published TF research code is that the vast majority of codebases use their own idiosyncratic layers library, as opposed to e.g. the ones in CODE or CODE, and these libraries are all different, which makes it more difficult than it should be to share work.",Motivation
1662,I often try to use TensorFlow on very large inputs (potentially >1GB minibatch) with relatively light computation on each minibatch.,Motivation
1663,"These inputs are in a HDF5 file or a Numpy array either on disk or in memory, so I typically feed with CODEfeed_dictCODE, potentially asynchronously into a queue.",Motivation

1680,My primary request is that however you build the new input pipeline system that it should be completely separate from the rest of the graph.,Expected Behaviour
1681,I'm giving a shot at migrating to tensorflow for our deep learning models for devices; but the input pipeline is so tightly bound to the rest of the compute graph that its like performing surgery to run inference against it.,Motivation
1682,Example: I trained using TFRecords and input queues; I got my weights/model.,Motivation
1683,I want to perform inference by running my prediction operation; but because the input queue runners etc are part of the graph before that; I am stuck with that mechanism for performing inference.,Motivation

1768,What @drasmuss suggests is very useful for segmentation tasks where both labels and images need to be augmented.,Motivation

1771,"We also used two separate queues, one handling input data_files as string names and the other one the resulting input data with preprocessing being done in between those two.",Motivation
1772,We needed to make sure that the enqueue operations fills at least a certain multiple of the batch size into the first queue for our code to run without problems (otherwise the second input queue stalled),Motivation
1773,"Now when I switched from a normal Session to using MonitoredSession and added a logging hook and told it to log the 'accuracy' tensor, it tried in vain to evaluate the first session run call as the hook had added that tensor to the fetch list, but with the queue being still empty there was no way to evaluate accuracy yet.",Motivation

1877,Currently the tutorial says that we can useCODEto get shuffled data.,Usage
1878,The pattern is also used in [CODE](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1efd7f171ba30421b5d8369a93526395a721c0d9/tensorflow/contrib/data/python/ops/dataset_ops.py#L595),Usage

1905,*         setting a timeout on the CODE of the training op and assuming that a timeout is due to the queue being exhausted (but the network connection might be down or our workers might be too slow),Workarounds
1906,*         counting the number of items we've processed and comparing with the expected number of items in the iterator (but that's fiddly and sometimes we don't even know how long the iterator is),Workarounds
1907,"*         adding an CODE field to the queue CODE and letting the background thread enqueue an item with CODE together with an assertion around the dequeue operation (but using CODE will dequeue elements from the next epoch if the number of items per epoch is not an integer multiple of the batch size, see also #2514)",Workarounds

3888,code workaround included works pip poetry,Workarounds
3889,"Of note - this PR is huge, but it was really difficult finding an intermediate point that wasn't unnecessarily convoluted.",Potential New Issues and Requests
3890,"Generally, the changes here can be abstracted as:

1.",Investigation and Exploration
3891,Placing all datetime related functions in pd_datetime.,Investigation and Exploration
3892,"{h, c}; these previously were spread across a few different files
2.",Investigation and Exploration
3893,"Having pd_datetime create the capsule; this unfortunately requires some monkeypatching of the pandas namespace
3.",Investigation and Exploration
3894,"Updating Cython files which use these functions to call `import_pandas_datetime`, similar to how the built-in datetime module works",Investigation and Exploration
3895,@MarcoGorelli @Dr-Irv would either of you be able to try this on windows and see if it fixes parallel compilation?,Investigation and Exploration
3896,"I think there is still some risk of file clashing due to the `""pandas/_libs/src/parser/tokenizer.c""` inclusion in the sources for tslibs.conversion which can be tackled in another PR, but hoping this eliminates the datetime symbol issues",Investigation and Exploration
3897,"Really suboptimal but unfortunately seems to be a limitation of the language for now...

As far as converting to Cython I personally think it would be pretty awkward to do that, but if someone wanted to try its certainly up for discussion.",Motivation

you get a `DataFrame` with the column named `foo`, so if someone knew that in there code, and did a `rename`, their code would break, since your proposal would be to name the column in this case `count`

I think that we'd need a deprecation cycle for this??",Expected Behaviour

4047,"In particular, for `df.groupby(col).apply(lambda df: df.value_counts)` the warning would be raised repeatedly, with no way (other than `warnings.filterwarnings`, which I don't think we should encourage) to turn it off

### 2. add `name` argument, raise warning if `name` is None

My issue is - what would the warning be?",Observed Bug Behaviour
4048,"The drawback here is that users may need to update their code - however, they'll almost certainly have to do that anyway given the number of changes in version 2.0.0, and if this was documented as one of the most visible changes, then users would probably see it

I'm not opposed to adding warnings / extra arguments, but I think it needs to have a warning of what users can do to make their code future-proof and accept the new behaviour - anyone have ideas for how to do this?",Expected Behaviour
4049,"See above, I am convinced we can provide an easy way to get the future behaviour with this new keyword (and in a way that could keep working the same in the future).",Motivation

4136,While I'm happy to continue discussing the technical details - which there are many to iron out - I feel the discussion would be greatly benefited by some additional context for this issue.,Motivation
4137,This will enable users and downstream packages to switch out one library for another.,Motivation
4138,"OK thanks that makes more sense to me then - removing `loc` by default (rather than changing its behaviour to be aligned with `iloc`, which is what I'd originally understood this it be about) would be a safer breaking change

4145,"If such a change in pandas would help the broader ecosystem (the other dataframe libraries) and the consortium / standard, then that's a good additional argument of course (and the consortium has also certainly been useful to trigger this discussion), but IMO it shouldn't be the primary argument.",Motivation
4146,"To be clear, I _do_ care about other dataframe libraries and the consortium ;), I think we should just not use this as a main motivation for a potential change, but rather because this is a good change for _our_ users (if we decide we indeed think it is).",Motivation
4147,"For example, if at some point this discussion gets summarized in a PDEP, it should start from why this would be useful for pandas users, not from ""this is raised in the consortium"" IMO.",Motivation
4148,"I think this part of ""why would this be useful for our users"" is also a bit missing from the discussion for now (unless that is clear already?",Motivation
4149,"but then it would still be useful to explicitly spell out)

The hackmd doc that Marco shared has a brief paragraph on this:

> A benefit to pandas users is that they could avoid a lot of unnecessary reset_indexs in people’s code.",Motivation
4150,It’s a fairly common operation.,Motivation
4151,"It would also avoid unexpected errors because of duplicates in the index, e.g.",Motivation

4156,I think there are several good reasons to have it as a separate concept from RangeIndex (while it is useful to _think_ about is as a different RangeIndex).,Motivation
4157,This would require something like #48126,Potential New Issues and Requests
4158,"While i am sympathetic to adding a NoIndex there are some concerns

- this would fundamentally change pandas and i don't think this would ever be possible as opt-out;
it would always need to be opt-in

- we already have a lot going on in pandas that are systematic changes : copy on write and array manager

i would be more amenable to starting something new if we finish things first (which practically would mean killing array manager)",Motivation
4159,"I've gone through with another iteration of the writeup: https://hackmd.io/JPWJqwc1SZKz_Zaxe9MZRQ

TL;DR: The proposal is to have:
- a way to create DataFrames without an Index
- a way to never end up with an index unless you ask for one (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/49069)
- an option `mode.opt_in_index` to make both of the above the default

I think #49069 is uncontroversial, so if it's OK I'll let the commenter know that it's OK to get started on it if they're still interested

| **18** | 0.67804 | 0.88187 |
| **34** | 0.71855 | 0.90719 |

I used the following data pipeline inspired by [the PyTorch docs](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_resnet/) (I removed the `num_parallel_calls` to make it more readable):
```python
ds = tfds.load(
'imagenet2012',
split='validation',
as_supervised=True,

lambda x, y: (
tf.image.resize_with_crop_or_pad(tf.image.resize(x, (256, 256)), 224, 224),

lambda x, y: (
tf.keras.applications.imagenet_utils.preprocess_input(
x, 
mode='torch',
),
tf.one_hot(y, 1000),

)

First use of cell was with scope 'rnn/multi_rnn_cell/cell_0/gru_cell', this attempt is with scope 'rnn/multi_rnn_cell/cell_1/gru_cell'. Please create a new instance of the cell if you would like it to use a different set of weights. If before you were using: MultiRNNCell([GRUCell(...)] * num_layers), change to: MultiRNNCell([GRUCell(...) for _ in range(num_layers)]). If before you were using the same cell instance as both the forward and reverse cell of a bidirectional RNN, simply create two instances (one for forward, one for reverse). In May 2017, we will start transitioning this cell's behavior to use existing stored weights, if any, when it is called with scope=None (which can lead to silent model degradation, so this error will remain until then.)",Bug Reproduction

TL;DR: The proposal is to have:
- a way to create DataFrames without an Index
- a way to never end up with an index unless you ask for one (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/49069)
- an option `mode.opt_in_index` to make both of the above the default

I think #49069 is uncontroversial, so if it's OK I'll let the commenter know that it's OK to get started on it if they're still interested

9725,I am trying to use the tensorflow/keras as server with multithreading.,Workarounds
9726,Obviously this is not a solution just a workaround.,Workarounds
9727,But it does get threading working with keras 2.3.1 / tensorflow 2.0,Workarounds
9728,I'm doing something like this:CODE,Workarounds
9729,"I am not a 100% sure about this topic, but it seems the latests gpu docker image fixed the leakage problem for me.",Workarounds
9730,"Try to use:
from tensorflow.keras import Input
instead of 
from keras import Input",Workarounds
9731,Some workarounds are,Workarounds
9732,"In the main ""post manager"" function I put this code...

`import keras.backend.tensorflow_backend as tb`
`tb._SYMBOLIC_SCOPE.value = True`

And this solved the problem for me...",Workarounds
9733,"However, I was able to use `model(tf.convert_to_tensor(np_input))`, which decreased memory leakage drastically.",Workarounds
9734,"from keras.utils import np_utils
change
from keras.utils.np_utils import *


sometime work...",Workarounds
9735,"@aliwelchoo @khanfarhan10 The `tensorflow.keras` works fine, but using `keras` directly is the only way to get `plaidml-keras` and using Metal and AMD GPU during learning on Mac",Workarounds
